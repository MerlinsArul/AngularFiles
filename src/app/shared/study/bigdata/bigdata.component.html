            Data is meaningless without the expertise to evaluate it,” says Jeanne Harris, a senior executive at the
            Accenture Institute for High Performance. There are many more job openings in big data and analytics this
            year than there are now last year, and many Technology professionals are willing to put in the time and
            money to learn
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            The demand for analytical talents is rapidly increasing, yet there is a significant supply gap. This is
            happening all across the world and isn’t limited to a specific spot.

            Data analytics is one of the top objectives for the organisations who participated in the study, according
            to the conclusions of the ‘Advanced Research with Big Data Analytics’ research, since they feel it enhances
            their businesses’ performance

            Increasingly complex data analytics on vast, heterogeneous datasets has become simpler thanks to
            technological advancements.

            Many businesses use analytics as a competitive advantage. Without a question. According to Tom Davenport’s
            ‘Analytics Advantage’ poll, 96% of respondents believe analytics will grow more vital to their companies.
