                        Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go
                        pricing.
                        Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access
                        technology services,
                        such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider
                        like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

            Cloud will become more secure and reliable in the future and it is maturing day by day. AWS, Azure, GCP, etc
            are making sure
            that it is mostly secured by default and providing lots of cloud-native in-build security mechanisms to
            deploy in just one click.

            that enables a company and its employees to conduct IT affairs in a remote environment but with much
