                        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components.
                         It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.
                         React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.
